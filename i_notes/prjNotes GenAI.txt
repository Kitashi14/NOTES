        upstream{

            task on which the model is dependent;
            when the model need a training data;
            its includes input data;
        }

        downstreak{

            task which is affected by the model;
            when prompt is given and data is received by the model;

}

genAI{

    these are large language models;

    it comes under deep learning, which uses neural networks;

    these models are used to produce data such as text, images, audios, etc;
    where as models that is used to produce a label, discrete values, numbers, etc. does not comes under genAI;
}

deep learning{

    it uses neural networks;
    it uses semi-supervised learning i.e. both supervised and unsupervised data is used for learning;

    deep learning models can be categorized into 2 types{

        discriminative{

            where you train a model to predict output of new inputs, regression and classification problems;
        }

        generative{

            where you train a model to create new data points;
        }
    }

}

neural networks{

    its inspired from our brain;
}

llm{

    large language models;
    its a subset of deep learning; 

    these are models that are pre-trained and can be fine-tuned for specific purposes;

    3 major features{

        large{

            large training data set;
            large no. of parameters;
        }

        general purpose{

            can solve common problems;
            such as text recognization, document sumarization, text generation, etc.; 

            resource is restricted as the large amount of data required for training are available to limited organizations only;
        }

        pretrained and fine tune{

            pretrain a llm for a general purpose with large dataset;
            then fine tune the model for specific purpose with much smaller dataset; 

        }

    }

    benefits: 
        a single llm can be used for different tasks (general purpose tasks);
        can be trailored/fine-tuned for a specific task with minimal data;
        performance is growing with increasing no. of data and parameters;
    
    demerits{

        expensive to train;
        result can be biased;
        can be used for generating harmful content;
    }

    concerns{

        hallucination: when the model generated content that are unreallistic, fictional or completely fabricated;

        factuality: truthfullness of the information;

        anthropomorphization: attribution of human-like qualities to non-human entities, such as AI;
    }

    eg.{

        palm{

            Pathway language model;
            it is a tranformer model;
    
        }
        
        lamda{

            language model for dialogue application;
        }
    }

    for llm development, you only need prompt design;
}

prompt design vs engineering{

    design{

        creating a prompt that is tailored for a specific task; 
    }

    engineering{

        process of creating a prompt that is designed to improve performance;
        involve using domain-specific knowledge, providing examples of the desired output;
    }
