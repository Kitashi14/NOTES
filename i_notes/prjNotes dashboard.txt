JIRA{

    software planning tool by atlassian;

    its a project management tool used by teams to plan, track, release and support world-class software;
    helps to capture and organize issues, assign work, and follow team activity;

tech debt{

    it is an issue type used to represent technical issues that need to be addressed to improve the long-term quality and maintainability of a system;

    it is a common concept in software development, where team leaders delay features and functionality, cut corners, or settle for suboptimal performance to push the project forward;

    it occurs as the result of a "build now, fix later" mentality;
    in software engineering, tech debt is sometimes called code debt;

design ideas{

    pages{

        a persons view page;
        a feature's profile page;
    }

    a person's view page{

        url : /dpl/view/:profile_id     #for a particular profile
        url ; /dpl/view                 #for home profile will show highest hirarchy view

        dropdown for selecting a particular person's view;

        option to select tag and type{

            if a particular tag or type is being selected then add pie chart if lower hierachy exist;

            if no lower hierachy exist then only show total counts of features;
        }

        show total no. of features;
        show selected tag and type in top;

        feature tag{

            donut chart with different feature tag distribution;
            optional: option for changing the view from pie chart to bar graph;
            adding drilldown if a lower hierarchy data exists;
        }

        feature type{

            donut chart with different feature status distribution;
            optional: option for changing the view from pie chart to bar graph;
        }

        feature status{

            pie chart graph showing the no. of features in different status;
        }

        feature release name{

            pie chart showing the no. of features under different release name;
        }

        feature pin{

            pie chart showing the no. of features under different pin;
        }

        table of content{

            will depend on the profile, selected tag and selected type;
        }

        two level of data representation and filter{

            level 1 is contains attributes that are of most importance, under which you would like to see the distribution of other attributes;
            level 2 contains attributes that have limited number of categories and can be shown in chart format or can have filters implemented under them;

            now how it works;

            if you select a category in level 1 then you can see their distribution in both level 1 & level 2;
            but you won't be able to select a category in level 2 and see their distribution in level 1 ;
        }
    }

    a feature's profile page{

        url : /dpl/feature/:feature_id

        timeline of the feature;
        percentage complete;
        different hyperlink;
        feature type;
    }
}
