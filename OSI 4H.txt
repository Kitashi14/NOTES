how it started{

    during cold war between soviet union and usa;
    a battle for launching the first satellite;
    USSR won with Sputnik in 1957;
    in response USA created ARPA;
}

ARPA{

    a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense;
    responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military;
    now renamed as DARPA;
    
    they had their bases at different parts of the USA;
    for communicating between these different bases they made ARPANET;
}

ARPANET{

    Advanced Research Projects Agency Network;
    the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control;
    one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite;
    established by the ARPA;

    there were mainly 4 nodal points which were connected to form a network;
    one at MIT, one at Utah, one at UCLA, one at Stanford;
    they used TCP protocol for this network;
}

protocol{
        a set of rules and regulations that are to be followed by all for attaining a proper harmony in the environment;

        made by Internet Society;
}


TCP{

    transmission control protocol;
    its a communication protocol;
    a global communication standard that devices used to transmit data;
    
    its a connection oriented protocol (i.e. both client and server had to be establish a connection first before sending data); 

    one of the main protocols of the internet-protocol-suite(TCP/IP) in the transport layer other than UDP(User Datagram Protocol);
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/

    retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP;
    used when we want full data to be received my the client/receiver without any loss or corruption;

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/

}

TCP ports{

    as per research tcp port is same as port(the network related one);
    its a 16-bit binary number;
    types of ports{
        well known;(0-1023)
        registered ports for applications;(1024-49,151)
        dynamics or say private port;(49,152-65,535)
    }
    
    https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/technology/networking/what-is-a-tcp-port-and-why-they-are-important
}

port{

    a port is a number assigned to {

        uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service;
        in OS, its to identify a specific process or a type of network service;
        in a normal device multiple applications can be running with a single ip address for the devide then its the port no. that is assigned to different applications to decide the endpoint;
    }

    its a 16-bit binary number;
    
    Ports are also numbered and used as global standards to identify specific processes or types of network services;
    https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-port-and-port-number
}


Datagram{

    its a unit/packet of data consisting of a header which have enough information to enable any switch to decide how to get it to its destination;
    every packet contains the complete destination address;

    it is used in datagram network which is often called connectionless network;
    in datagram network there is no handshake and every switch decides where the datagram will head to using forwarding table(aka routing table);

    when the network becomes large and complex then its diffucult to create forwarding table, its then that we use the method called routing;
    routing is a process that takes place in the background so that, when a data packet arrives, we will have the right information in the forwarding table to be able to forward, or switch, the packet;

    UDP(User Datagram Protocol) is used for this network;
    in this it is not necessary to recieve 100% of the original data;

    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/datagram-network

}

http { 
    hypertext transfer protocol;
    communication protocol;
    it is a member of the TCP/IP family;

    web server and client communicate using http;
    its a synchronous protocol;
    uses port 80;

    protocol for formatting/fetching/transferring resources/data like HTML doc, files, media etc. (hypermedia);
    http request and response is used to exchange information between web server and client; 

    when a http url is directly fetched then it acts as a get method by default;
    different methods helps us to use same endpoints for different request;

}


synchronous protocol{
    
    in a synchronous protocol when a request is send then the other side waits for the response then proceed;
    
    http is a synchronous protocol as the client wait for the response or timeout to occur;
    
    it operates in a blocking manner i.e. clien't request blocks further execution;
    this can lead to potential delay if the server takes longer time to process data;

    there are asynchronous protocols also due to this like websocket;
}

websocket{

    it is an asynchronous communication protocol;
    it provides full duplex, two way communication over a single TCP connection;

    it allows an open connection so that no new connections is required to be formed for every new request;
    it can send and receive data at any time;

    it is used for application like online gaming, chat application etc which requires real time updates;

}

duplexes{

    full duplex{

        allow data transmission in both directions simultaneously;
        achieved by using seperate channels or frequency bands for sending and receiving data;
    }

    half duplex{

        data can be transmitted in both the directions but not at same time;
        it has to take turns to either send or receive data;
    }

    simplex{

        its a unidirectional communication;
        data can be transmitted from one direction only;
        eg. tv, radio, etc.;
    }

}

tcp vs http{

    TCP contains information about what data has or has not been received;
    HTTP contains specific instructions on how to read and process the data once it's received; 
    TCP manages the data stream;
    HTTP describes what the data in the stream contains;
}

WWW{

    World Wide Web (WWW);
    commonly known as the Web;
    is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet;
    it uses hyperlinks and URL for linking the contents of internet to each other;

    first website : info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
}

search engines{ 

    a software system designed to carry out web searches;
    they search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information;
    information specified in a textual web search query;

}

URL{

    uniform resource locator;

    it is a unique address of a file on the internet;
    it is composed of {

        protocol{
            http, https;
        }
        domain name{
            www.websitename.com , www.websitename.org;
        }
        relative path to be loaded aka subdirectories{
            /home, /login ;
        }
    }
}

TCP/IP {

    Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol;
    aka The Internet protocol suite;

    TCP/IP is a family of communication protocols;
    used to connect computer systems in a network;
    it is named after two of the protocols in the family:
        1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP);
        2. Internet Protocol (IP);
    
    a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols;
    used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria;


}

ip address {

    internet protocol address;

    unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network;
    
    in case of hostname, ip address of the particular device in the computer network is pointed;
    ip is used to tell the destination;
    
    in case of domain name, ip address of the web server(a device) 
    who stores the data/webpage for that site is pointed;
    
    multiple domain name may have same ip address when the same server is
    storing/hosting data/webpages of different sites, this is called shared hosting;

    https://superuser.com/questions/577070/is-it-possible-for-many-domain-names-to-share-one-ip-address 

    ip address format {

        x.x.x.x         //each range from 0-255;

    }

}

server {

    A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user; 
    also known as the client;
    eg. in a data center, the physical computer that a program runs on is referred to as a server;

}

proxy vs nat vs vpn {

    NAT (Network Address Translation){

        Function: NAT is used to map private IP addresses within a local network to a single public IP address, allowing multiple devices to share the same public IP when accessing the internet;

        Purpose: It helps conserve IPv4 addresses and acts as a basic firewall by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks;

        Privacy: NAT doesn't provide privacy or encryption for data transmission. It primarily focuses on translating IP addresses;

        Usage: Commonly used in home routers and small networks to connect multiple devices to the internet;
        
    }

    Proxy Server{

        Function: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and a destination server. It forwards client requests and receives responses on behalf of the client;

        Purpose: Proxies can provide caching, content filtering, anonymity, and access control. They can also help improve network performance by caching frequently requested content;

        Privacy: While proxies can offer some degree of anonymity, they do not necessarily encrypt the entire data transmission, leaving data vulnerable to interception;

        Usage: Often used in corporate environments to control internet access, in web scraping, and for bypassing geographical restrictions;
    
    }

    VPN (Virtual Private Network){

        Function: A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and a remote server, encrypting all data transmitted through the tunnel;

        Purpose: VPNs offer enhanced privacy, security, and anonymity by encrypting internet traffic, making it difficult for third parties to intercept or access data;

        Privacy: VPNs provide a higher level of privacy compared to proxies, as they encrypt all data, including browsing activities, preventing ISPs and others from monitoring;

        Usage: Used to ensure security on public Wi-Fi networks, access geographically restricted content, and maintain privacy while browsing;
    
    }
    
    In summary, NAT is primarily concerned with conserving IP addresses and providing basic security, while proxy servers offer some level of anonymity and control over internet traffic. VPNs excel in providing privacy, security, and encryption for all transmitted data, making them ideal for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining online anonymity.
}

ipv4 vs ipv6{

    IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4){

        Address Length: IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for a total of about 4.3 billion unique addresses;

        Address Format: IPv4 addresses are written in four sets of decimal numbers (octets) separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1);

        Scarcity: Due to the limited address space, IPv4 addresses are becoming increasingly scarce as the demand for internet-connected devices grows;

        NAT (Network Address Translation): NAT is commonly used to mitigate the address shortage by allowing multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address;

        Complexity: IPv4 header has fewer fields and options, which can lead to inefficient routing and slower performance;

        Security: Security features are often added separately, making IPv4 networks more susceptible to certain types of attacks;

        Transition: The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 involves challenges and complexities, as it's not backwards-compatible;


    }   

    IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6){

        Address Length: IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, providing an immensely larger address space with approximately 340 undecillion unique addresses;

        Address Format: IPv6 addresses are written in eight sets of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334);

        Abundance: IPv6 was developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and provide a sustainable solution for the growing number of internet-enabled devices;

        No NAT Needed: With its vast address space, IPv6 eliminates the need for NAT, allowing devices to have unique global addresses;

        Efficiency: IPv6 headers are more efficient and include improved routing options, leading to better performance;

        Security: IPv6 was designed with security in mind, with features like IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) being an integral part of the protocol;

        Transition: IPv6 has been designed to facilitate a smoother transition from IPv4, with mechanisms like dual-stack (running both IPv4 and IPv6) and tunneling;

    }

    In summary, IPv6 offers a solution to the addressing limitations and security concerns of IPv4, but its widespread adoption has been gradual due to the challenges associated with transitioning existing networks and devices to the new protocol.

LAN{

    local area network;
    via ethernet cables, wifi;
}

    which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given large area with multiple buildings
}

WAN{

    wide area network;
    across a country;
    a large network of information that is not tied to a single location;
    the largest and most expansive forms of computer networks available;
    often established by service providers that then lease their WAN to businesses, schools, governments or the public;
}

modem{

}

OSI model{

    open systems interconnection model;
    consists of 7 layers;
    used for communication by computer systems over the internet;
    it was the first standard model for network communications;

    routers operate on the third layer of the OSI Model, the network-control Layer;
    a router examines the packet's data structure and determines whether or not to forward it, rather than passing packets based on the Media Access Control (MAC) Layer addresses (as bridges do); 

    the seven layers{

        application;
        presentation;
        session;
        transport;
        network;
        data link;
        physical;
    }
}

application layer{

    involves the applications or say software;
    it has protocols like http, ftp, TELNET etc.;

    its the layer which user interacts with;
    eg. whatsapp, browsers, etc;

    
}
presentation layer{

    it converts the data the human readable data into machine readable binary format;
    eg. from ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) to EBCDIC (extended binary-coded decimal interchange code);

    it involves translating, encoding, encryption, compression etc;
    it also provides abstraction;

}

session layer{

    establising the sesssion;
    involves authentication and authoritation;
}

transport layer{

    it determines how the data will be transferred;
    eg. UDP & TCP;

    it involves segmentation:
        every segment will contain the source and destination port no. and a sequence no.;
    
    it also involves flow control, error control, check sum and other things;

    two types:
        connection oriented protocol => TCP;
        connectionless protocol => UDP;
}

network layer{

    involves the transmission of the received data segment;
    
    till transport layer the data was available in our own system/network;
    in network layer it starts communicating with other computers;

    router is presents in this layer;

    it involves logical addressing:
        assigns the senders and recievers ip address to every segments;
    
    it also involves routing, load balancing;
}

data link layer{

    it involves formation of frames{

        frames are the data unit/ pdu of data link layer;
        it contains the physical address of the sender and receiver;
        physical address means the MAC address;

        MAC address{

            media access control;
            
            its a 12-digit alpha numeric address of the network interface of the computer;
            one computer doesn't have a single mac address, its bluetooth, wifi, etc. all can have different MAC address;
        }
    }
}

physical layer{

    its contains the hardware part;
    binary data recieved from previous layer will be converted to digital signals;
    these digital signals are then transported using wires and cables;
}


TCP/IP model{

    also known as internet protocol suite;
    developed by ARPA;

    5 layers are present{

        application;
        transport;
        network;
        data link;
        physical;
    }
}

client-server vs peer-to-peer architecture{

    in client-server architecture a computer acts as a client or a server;
    
    in peer-to-peer architecture a computer cant act both as a client or a server;
    its a decentralized architecture;
    for eg. bit torrent, block chain (my opinion);
}

repeater{

    present in physical layer; 
    it regenerates the signal over the same network;
    regenerates before it becomes weak or corrupted;

    they do not amplifies the signal;
    they regenerates the signal at original strength;

    its a 2 port device;
}

hub{

    its like a multiport repeater;
    it connects multiple wires coming from different branches;

    it cannot filter data so data are sent to all connected devices;
    it doesn't breaks collision domain;
    all hosts connected through a hub have a single collision domain;

    types of hub{

        active hub {

            these hubs have there own power supply;
            can clean, boost and relay the signal along the network;
            serves both as repeaters as well as wiring center;
            can be used to extend distance between nodes;
        }

        passive hub{

            these collect wiring from nodes and power from active hub;
            relays signal onto the network without cleaning and boosting them;
            can't be used to extend distance between nodes;
        }
    }
}



collision domain{

    when a device sends out a message to the network, all other devices which are included in its collision domain have to pay attention to it, no matter if it was destined for them or not;
    it causes problem;
    in a situation where two devices send out their messages simultaneously, a collision will occur leading them to wait and re-transmit their respective messages, one at a time;

    router and switches breaks collision domain;
    hub doesn't breaks collision domain;
}

broadcast domain{

    when a device sends out a broadcast message, all the devices present in its broadcast domain have to pay attention to it;
    creates a lot of congestion in the network;
    affects the bandwidth of the users present in that network;

    router breaks broadcast domain;
    hub and switches doesn't breaks broadcast domain;
}

congestion{

    refers to a reduction in QOS(quality of service);
    causes packet loss, queueing delay, or the blocking of new connections;
    occurs in cases of traffic overloading when a link or network node is handling data in excess of its capacity
}

routing{


}

routers vs switches{

    both are network connecting devices;

    router connects devices across multiple networks;
    it works at mainly network layer;
    finds the shortest path for a packet across the network;
    it doesn't encrypt data while routing them;
    most commonly used in the LAN and WAN domains;
    its most expensive among hub, switches and routers;

    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-router-and-switch#

    switches connect various devices in a network;
    it works in data link layer;
    it transmit data from multiple input ports to a certain output port;
    also known as a multiport bridge;
    it is used in LAN;
