how it started{

    during cold war between soviet union and usa;
    a battle for launching the first satellite;
    USSR won with Sputnik in 1957;
    in response USA created ARPA;
}

ARPA{

    a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense;
    responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military;
    now renamed as DARPA;
    
    they had their bases at different parts of the USA;
    for communicating between these different bases they made ARPANET;
}

ARPANET{

    Advanced Research Projects Agency Network;
    the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control;
    one of the first networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite;
    established by the ARPA;

    there were mainly 4 nodal points which were connected to form a network;
    one at MIT, one at Utah, one at UCLA, one at Stanford;
    they used TCP protocol for this network;
}

protocol{
        a set of rules and regulations that are to be followed by all for attaining a proper harmony in the environment;

        made by Internet Society;
}


TCP{

    transmission control protocol;
    its a communication protocol;
    a global communication standard that devices used to transmit data;
    
    its a connection oriented protocol (i.e. both client and server had to be establish a connection first before sending data); 

    one of the main protocols of the internet-protocol-suite(TCP/IP) in the transport layer other than UDP(User Datagram Protocol);
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/

    retransmission of lost data packets is only possible with TCP;
    used when we want full data to be received my the client/receiver without any loss or corruption;

    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/

}

TCP ports{

    as per research tcp port is same as port(the network related one);
    its a 16-bit binary number;
    types of ports{
        well known;(0-1023)
        registered ports for applications;(1024-49,151)
        dynamics or say private port;(49,152-65,535)
    }
    
    https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/technology/networking/what-is-a-tcp-port-and-why-they-are-important
}

port{

    a port is a number assigned to {

        uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service;
        in OS, its to identify a specific process or a type of network service;
        in a normal device multiple applications can be running with a single ip address for the devide then its the port no. that is assigned to different applications to decide the endpoint;
    }

    its a 16-bit binary number;
    
    Ports are also numbered and used as global standards to identify specific processes or types of network services;
    https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-port-and-port-number
}


Datagram{

    its a unit/packet of data consisting of a header which have enough information to enable any switch to decide how to get it to its destination;
    every packet contains the complete destination address;

    it is used in datagram network which is often called connectionless network;
    in datagram network there is no handshake and every switch decides where the datagram will head to using forwarding table(aka routing table);

    when the network becomes large and complex then its diffucult to create forwarding table, its then that we use the method called routing;
    routing is a process that takes place in the background so that, when a data packet arrives, we will have the right information in the forwarding table to be able to forward, or switch, the packet;

    UDP(User Datagram Protocol) is used for this network;
    in this it is not necessary to recieve 100% of the original data;

    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/datagram-network

}

http { 
    hypertext transfer protocol;
    communication protocol;
    it is a member of the TCP/IP family;

    web server and client communicate using http;
    its a synchronous protocol;
    uses port 80;

    protocol for formatting/fetching/transferring resources/data like HTML doc, files, media etc. (hypermedia);
    http request and response is used to exchange information between web server and client; 

    when a http url is directly fetched then it acts as a get method by default;
    different methods helps us to use same endpoints for different request;

}

tcp vs http{

    TCP contains information about what data has or has not been received;
    HTTP contains specific instructions on how to read and process the data once it's received; 
    TCP manages the data stream;
    HTTP describes what the data in the stream contains;
}

WWW{

    World Wide Web (WWW);
    commonly known as the Web;
    is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet;
    it uses hyperlinks and URL for linking the contents of internet to each other;

    first website : info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
}

search engines{ 

    a software system designed to carry out web searches;
    they search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information;
    information specified in a textual web search query;

}

URL{

    uniform resource locator;

    it is a unique address of a file on the internet;
    it is composed of {

        protocol{
            http, https;
        }
        domain name{
            www.websitename.com , www.websitename.org;
        }
        relative path to be loaded aka subdirectories{
            /home, /login ;
        }
    }
}

TCP/IP {

    Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol;
    aka The Internet protocol suite;

    TCP/IP is a family of communication protocols;
    used to connect computer systems in a network;
    it is named after two of the protocols in the family:
        1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP);
        2. Internet Protocol (IP);
    
    a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols;
    used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria;


}

ip address {

    internet protocol address;

    unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network;
    
    in case of hostname, ip address of the particular device in the computer network is pointed;
    ip is used to tell the destination;
    
    in case of domain name, ip address of the web server(a device) 
    who stores the data/webpage for that site is pointed;
    
    multiple domain name may have same ip address when the same server is
    storing/hosting data/webpages of different sites, this is called shared hosting;

    https://superuser.com/questions/577070/is-it-possible-for-many-domain-names-to-share-one-ip-address 

    ip address format {

        x.x.x.x         //each range from 0-255;

    }

}

server {

    A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user; 
    also known as the client;
    eg. in a data center, the physical computer that a program runs on is referred to as a server;

    https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/server
}

LAN{

    local area network;
    via ethernet cables, wifi;
}

MAN{

    metropolitan area network;
    across a city;
    a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area;
    which could be a single large city, multiple cities and towns, or any given large area with multiple buildings
}

WAN{

    wide area network;
    across a country;
    a large network of information that is not tied to a single location;
    the largest and most expansive forms of computer networks available;
    often established by service providers that then lease their WAN to businesses, schools, governments or the public;
}

modem{

    converts digital signal to analog signals;
}

routers{

    routes the data package based on their ip address;
}

topologies{

    bus topology;
    ring topology;
    star topology;
    tree topology (bus+star);
    mesh topology;
}

OSI model{

    open systems interconnection model;
    consists of 7 layers;
    used for communication by computer systems over the internet;
    it was the first standard model for network communications;

    routers operate on the third layer of the OSI Model, the network-control Layer;
    a router examines the packet's data structure and determines whether or not to forward it, rather than passing packets based on the Media Access Control (MAC) Layer addresses (as bridges do); 

    the seven layers{

        application;
        presentation;
        session;
        transport;
        network;
        data link;
        physical;
    }
}

application layer{

    involves the applications or say software;
    it has protocols like http, ftp, TELNET etc.;

    its the layer which user interacts with;
    eg. whatsapp, browsers, etc;

    
}
presentation layer{

    it converts the data the human readable data into machine readable binary format;
    eg. from ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) to EBCDIC (extended binary-coded decimal interchange code);

    it involves translating, encoding, encryption, compression etc;
    it also provides abstraction;

}

session layer{

    establising the sesssion;
    involves authentication and authoritation;
}

transport layer{

    it determines how the data will be transferred;
    eg. UDP & TCP;

    it involves segmentation:
        every segment will contain the source and destination port no. and a sequence no.;
    
    it also involves flow control, error control, check sum and other things;

    two types:
        connection oriented protocol => TCP;
        connectionless protocol => UDP;
}

network layer{

    involves the transmission of the received data segment;
    
    till transport layer the data was available in our own system/network;
    in network layer it starts communicating with other computers;

    router is presents in this layer;

    it involves logical addressing:
        assigns the senders and recievers ip address to every segments;
    
    it also involves routing, load balancing;
}

data link layer{

    it involves formation of frames{

        frames are the data unit/ pdu of data link layer;
        it contains the physical address of the sender and receiver;
        physical address means the MAC address;

        MAC address{

            media access control;
            
            its a 12-digit alpha numeric address of the network interface of the computer;
            one computer doesn't have a single mac address, its bluetooth, wifi, etc. all can have different MAC address;
        }
    }
}

physical layer{

    its contains the hardware part;
    binary data recieved from previous layer will be converted to digital signals;
    these digital signals are then transported using wires and cables;
}


TCP/IP model{

    also known as internet protocol suite;
    developed by ARPA;

    5 layers are present{

        application;
        transport;
        network;
        data link;
        physical;
    }
}

client-server vs peer-to-peer architecture{

    in client-server architecture a computer acts as a client or a server;
    
    in peer-to-peer architecture a computer cant act both as a client or a server;
    its a decentralized architecture;
    for eg. bit torrent, block chain (my opinion);
}

repeater{

    present in physical layer; 
    it regenerates the signal over the same network;
    regenerates before it becomes weak or corrupted;

    they do not amplifies the signal;
    they regenerates the signal at original strength;

    its a 2 port device;
}

hub{

    its like a multiport repeater;
    it connects multiple wires coming from different branches;

    it cannot filter data so data are sent to all connected devices;
    it doesn't breaks collision domain;
    all hosts connected through a hub have a single collision domain;

    types of hub{

        active hub {

            these hubs have there own power supply;
            can clean, boost and relay the signal along the network;
            serves both as repeaters as well as wiring center;
            can be used to extend distance between nodes;
        }

        passive hub{

            these collect wiring from nodes and power from active hub;
            relays signal onto the network without cleaning and boosting them;
            can't be used to extend distance between nodes;
        }
    }
}



collision domain{

    when a device sends out a message to the network, all other devices which are included in its collision domain have to pay attention to it, no matter if it was destined for them or not;
    it causes problem;
    in a situation where two devices send out their messages simultaneously, a collision will occur leading them to wait and re-transmit their respective messages, one at a time;

    router and switches breaks collision domain;
    hub doesn't breaks collision domain;
}

broadcast domain{

    when a device sends out a broadcast message, all the devices present in its broadcast domain have to pay attention to it;
    creates a lot of congestion in the network;
    affects the bandwidth of the users present in that network;

    router breaks broadcast domain;
    hub and switches doesn't breaks broadcast domain;
}

congestion{

    refers to a reduction in QOS(quality of service);
    causes packet loss, queueing delay, or the blocking of new connections;
    occurs in cases of traffic overloading when a link or network node is handling data in excess of its capacity

routing{


}

routers vs switches{

    both are network connecting devices;

    router connects devices across multiple networks;
    it works at mainly network layer;
    finds the shortest path for a packet across the network;
    it doesn't encrypt data while routing them;
    most commonly used in the LAN and WAN domains;
    its most expensive among hub, switches and routers;

    https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-router-and-switch#

    switches connect various devices in a network;
    it works in data link layer;
    it transmit data from multiple input ports to a certain output port;
    also known as a multiport bridge;
    it is used in LAN;
