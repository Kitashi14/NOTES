categories{

    supervised{
        
        data are labeled, different features are specified; 
        we provide correct outputs for given input data points used for training;
        
        types{
            classification : draws a line to differentiate;
            regression : a measure of the relation between output and corresponding values of other variables;
        }
    }

    unsupervised {

        data are not labeled, no features are specified;
        we don't have any specific output for the given input data points;
        it is used for exploratory data analysis and finding hidden patterns/features or groups in data;

            clustering;
            rule learning;

    reinforcement learing{

        using reward and punishment system;
        eg. playing a game;

            skill acquisition;

defination of ML{

    using algorithms to learn about differnt patterns in data and then using that algorithm to predict about future using similar data;

    it works of experience basis;
    the more the model has experience the better it becomes;
