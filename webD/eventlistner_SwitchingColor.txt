Event Bubbling and capturing are 2 ways of propagation in DOM TREE.

Bubbling ={
    it is the default case.
    in this the propagation happens from child to parent
}

capturing = {
    it is needed to be set to happen.
    in this the propagation happens from the parent to child.
    if all events are not set to 'capture' mode in a nested tree then those set as 'capture' will be executed first in the order of last generation to first generation
}
