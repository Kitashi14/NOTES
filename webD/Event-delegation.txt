Event delegation is a technique of handling events in a better way.

It uses the event bubbling property of javascript.

It helps in reducing the amount of code like eventlistner attached to each child elements.
    It uses bubbling property to use only one
eventlistner for all childs.

In the example html file there is also an example of dataset. (IMPORTANT)
