    SOP {
        same origin policy;
        it allows scripts running on pages originating from the  'same site' to access each other's DOM with no specific restrictions, but prevents access to the DOM on different sites;

    }

    blob {

        A blob object is simply a collection of bytes that contains data stored in a file.
    }
    createObjectURL {
        
        static method creates a string containing a URL representing the object given in the parameter.
        The URL lifetime is tied to the document in the window on which it was created. The new object URL represents the specified File object or Blob object.

    UML {

        Unified modelling language;
        a graphical modelling language in software engineering;
        use case diagram is one of it;
    }
};

HTML{

    HyperText MarkUP language;
    its the standard markup language for document designed to be displayed in a web browsers;

    its standard is maintained and developed by WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group);

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
}

hypertext {

    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites;
    
    Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
} 

markup language{

    A computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names or tags;
    
    it helps to format the overall view of a page and the data it contains;
     
    Some examples of a markup language are BBC, HTML, SGML, and XML

    md(markdown) is also a lightweight markup language that is used in readme files;
}

CSS {

    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language;
    
    it instructs the browser how we want our HTML to appear; 
    it is used to describe the presentation of a markup language;
    
    it is not a programming language;
}

Javascript{

    javascript is a scripting language;
    it uses an interpreter for converting high-level language into machine codes;

    Javascript is the language used in WWW and by all browsers;
    all different browsers have different JS engines for interpretting JS codes;
    the core architecture Javascript is based on different version of ECMAScript(ES);

    eg. JS ES1, ES5, ES6(supported by most browsers);
}

scripting vs programming language{

    scripting language uses a interpreter(in a run-time environment) while programming language uses compiler;

    for a scripting language there is no need to make an executable file unlike programming language;
    normally for a scripting language shell is there to write line by line executable code;

    a scripting language is a programming language(in the sense that it is also used to write programmes only);
    a scripting language doesn't generally compiles the code rather interpret it;
    a programming language compiles the whole code;

    in scripting language interpreter is used which reads the code line by line;

    in modern world differnce between the two is becoming blur with advancement of technology;
    we can make an environment to compile a scripting language(making it a non-scripting language);
    eg. google chrome V8 engine for JS;

    we can also make an run-time environment to interpret a programming language (making it a scripting language);

    eg. for scripting language : JS, python, php;
    for programming language : c, cpp,
}

JS engines {

    for running javascript we need an environment, these environment are found_in/called JS engine;
    there are different version of javascript and these are to be supported by js engine for javascript to run correctly;

    every browser have a JS engine in it;
    eg. chakra (edge), v8 (chrome), spider monkey (firefox);

    NOTE: most engine have interpreter designed to interpret the js but V8 compiles the js;
}

ECMAScript {

    European Computer Manufacturers Association Script;

    its a standard used for implementation of different scripting languages;
    JS uses this standard;
    it help to ensure that different browsers are interoperatable with each other as browsers use JS;

    almost every every this standard is updated adding new features for the language;
    different versions of ECMAScript: ES1, ES2, ES3, ES6, ES7;
    https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp

}

windows_object & Web APIs{

    in browser there are many APIs used that are not part of javascript or say ECMAScript;
    eg. DOM object, fetch, setTimer, XHR, etc;

    these are part of the Web platform API defined by the standards of  WHATWG and W3C (World Wide Web Consortium);
}

fetch api{

    its an api used for sending http requests;
    it supports both http and https protocol;

    its a replacement for XMLHttpRequest(XHR) api which was used in AJAX;
    fetch api uses promises for simplicity unlike XHR in which we have to use callback functions;
}

AJAX{

    Asynchrounous Javascript and XML;   
    not a programming language;

    its a method used to update/change a part of the webpage without reloading the whole web page;
    it exchange data from the web server bts and change the part of the webpage;

    uses combination of: 
        built-in XMLHttpRequest object;
        Javascript and DOM module;
}

json{

    its a standard for formatting document and used to communicate;
    beside json xml format was used;

    JSON.stringify(object);  //to convert a js object to json object
    JSON.parse(jsonFile);   //to convert a json object to js object
    jsonFile.json();        //to convert a json object to js object 
}

.json() vs JSON.parse(){

    Body.json() is asynchronous and returns a Promise object that resolves to a JavaScript object;
    JSON.parse() is synchronous can parse a string and change the resulting returned JavaScript object;

    use .json() with promise returning function like fetch;
    use JSON.parse() with callback supporting function like request, AJAX;
}

In src attribute of any element{

    when using prepending slash without dot "/location"{

        it will start fetching from root dir when html file opened locally on the browser.
        it will start fetching from current dir when html file opened through a server. 
    } 

    when using prepending slash with= dot "./location"{

        it will always start fetching from current dir.
    }

    reference link : https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/

}

accessing local files through browser {

    when using live server or any server u won't to able to access root dir(not allowed to access local files);
    for using files either copy it in src folder or open the html file locally;

    "Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP"

    open it using http-server {

        1. Install http-server by typing "npm install -g http-server"
        2. Change into your working directory, where your "some.html" lives
        3. Start your http server by issuing http-server -c-1

        This spins up a Node.js http which serves the files(js, css etc.) in your directory as static files accessible from http://localhost:8080
    }

}

blob{

    stands for binary large object;

    its a file like object of immutable, raw data;
    can be read as text or binary data;
    can be converted to readableStream (its method can be used for processing the data);

    new Blob([ data ], {type:"text/plain", endings: "transparent"||"native"});

    new File([ data ], filename, {type:"text/plain", lastModified: Date.now()});

    data - Blob, ArrayBuffer, TypedArray, DataView, String (utf-8 string), a mixture;

    File is a sub-class of Blob. Can often be used interchangeably;
    Once you have a Blob/File then you can use it:
        - upload via fetch as a file or stream;
        - save it in the cache;
        - add a link in a webpage to the file;
        - display it as an image (if image);
        - read the text contents (json, txt, html...) and:
            - display on page;
            - parse the html, xml, json, etc;
            - save in localStorage or cookie;


    ArrayBuffer - raw data as a fixed-length string of bytes. It is NOT an Array.

    DataView - an interpretation of some raw bytes expressed as 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit,
        or 64-bit integers. Used to add or edit data in an ArrayBuffer. Like a wrapper 
        for ArrayBuffers if you need to edit them. It is a View of the Data from the ArrayBuffer;

    TypedArray - It is an Array-like view of raw bytes stored as 
        8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit  integers, clamped integers, 
        signed and unsigned integers, or floats;

}

input "file" {

    it stores the file in file object(a sub-class of blob);

    <input type="file" title="choose file" />;

    //specifying type of file to select 
    <input type="file" title="choose file" accept="images/*" />;    (images);
    one can put file-extensions or mime-type(media-type / Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) or both in the "accept" attribute;
    eg. text/html, .html, text/xml, .xml, text/css, .css, application/json, .json, text/json etc.

    //for selecting multiple file 
    <input type="file" title="choose file" multiple />;
}

cdnjs{

    using this site to get different cdn links for different libraries and modules;
}

immutable vs mutable{

    one can't change the content of immutable data;
    one can only assign an entirely new created data to the variable which is holding an immutable data;

    in javascript primitive data(data that is not an object and has no methods or properties) a immutable;

    eg. 
    immutable: boolean, number, string, symbol etc.;
    mutable: array, object, map, date etc.;
}
